In frontend development, the term "interceptor" is often associated with the concept of HTTP request and response interceptors, which are used to perform various tasks related to network requests. The number of interceptors in a frontend application can vary widely based on the complexity of the application and the specific requirements. Typically, you might have several types of interceptors, including:

1. **HTTP Request Interceptors:** These interceptors are responsible for modifying outgoing HTTP requests before they are sent to the server. Common use cases include adding authentication headers, handling request caching, or logging request details.

2. **HTTP Response Interceptors:** These interceptors handle incoming HTTP responses from the server. They are used for tasks like error handling, response data transformation, and response logging.

3. **Authentication Interceptors:** If your application uses authentication, you might have interceptors dedicated to managing authentication tokens, renewing expired tokens, and handling unauthorized access.

4. **Error Interceptors:** These interceptors focus on handling errors that occur during network requests. They can centralize error logging, transform error responses into a consistent format, or redirect to error pages.

5. **Loading and Progress Interceptors:** In applications with complex user interfaces, you might implement interceptors to manage loading indicators or progress bars to provide feedback to users during API requests.

6. **Request Retry Interceptors:** To handle network issues or transient errors, request retry interceptors can be used to automatically retry failed requests a certain number of times.

7. **Data Transformation Interceptors:** If you need to preprocess or transform data before it is displayed to the user, you can use interceptors for this purpose. For example, you might use an interceptor to format dates or sanitize user input.

8. **Logging Interceptors:** Logging interceptors capture information about requests and responses for debugging, auditing, or monitoring purposes. They can help in tracking down issues and understanding how your application communicates with the server.

The actual number and types of interceptors in your frontend application depend on the complexity of your application, the specific requirements, and the architecture you're using. For smaller applications, you might have just a few interceptors, while larger and more complex applications may have many interceptors to handle various aspects of network communication and data processing.

It's essential to strike a balance between using interceptors to simplify common tasks and avoiding overuse, which can lead to code complexity. Keep your interceptors well-organized and ensure they follow best practices to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.
